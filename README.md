Razensoft.Mediator
======================================================

Simple mediator library for Unity. This library is inspired by MediatR in many ways but it adds a separation of input/output handling and sync/async requests to make it more suitable for gamedev needs.

## Installation

Add this line to your `manifest.json` file:

```
"com.razensoft.mediator": "https://github.com/Razenpok/Razensoft.Mediator.git?path=src/Razensoft.Mediator#1.0.0",
```

UPM should automatically install the package.
