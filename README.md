Razensoft.Mediator
======================================================

Simple mediator library for Unity. This library is inspired by MediatR in many ways but it adds a separation of input/output handling and sync/async requests to make it more suitable for gamedev needs.

- **Plain install**: Clone or [download](https://github.com/Razenpok/Razensoft.Mediator/archive/master.zip) this repository and put it somewhere in your Unity project
